While your iPhone is charging and playing music, you can’t see what time it is.In iOS 26, Apple introduced a new Full-Screen Album Art view on the iPhone’s Lock Screen.

On first look it’s stunning but after using it for a few months, I’ve found a fundamental problem.

The problem is with the time and date. Normally on the lock screen the time sits large and prominent, with the date on the time. In the album art view, both are squeezed onto a single horizontal line, visually demoting the time from the most important element on the screen to just another piece of information.
